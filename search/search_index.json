Web applications can protect users against these types of attacks by implementing CSRF tokens in their forms which are known only to the application that generated them and must be included when submitting forms. With each visit, a new CSRF token is added to the form so tokens are not reusable between forms. Missing to provide a valid CSRF token will result in a form validation error. Implement CSRF protection Implementing CSRF protection requires three steps: create new field using laminas/laminas-form 's CSRF element validate new field using laminas/laminas-session 's CSRF validator render field using laminas/laminas-form 's FormElement helper Create field Open the form's PHP class and append the following code to the method that initializes the fields (usually init ): $this-&gt;add(new \\Laminas\\Form\\Element\\Csrf('exampleCsrf', [ 'csrf_options' =&gt; [ 'timeout' =&gt; 3600, 'session' =&gt; new \\Laminas\\Session\\Container(), ], ])); where exampleCsrf should be a suggestive name that describes the purpose of the field (example: forgotPasswordCsrf ). Validate field Open the InputFilter that validates the form fields and append the following code to the method that initializes the fields (usually init ): $csrf = new \\Laminas\\InputFilter\\Input('exampleCsrf'); $csrf-&gt;setRequired(true); $csrf-&gt;getFilterChain() -&gt;attachByName(\\Laminas\\Filter\\StringTrim::class) -&gt;attachByName(\\Laminas\\Filter\\StripTags::class); $csrf-&gt;getValidatorChain() -&gt;attachByName(\\Laminas\\Validator\\NotEmpty::class, [ 'message' =&gt; '&lt;b&gt;CSRF&lt;/b&gt; is required and cannot be empty', ], true) -&gt;attachByName(\\Laminas\\Session\\Validator\\Csrf::class, [ 'name' =&gt; 'exampleCsrf', 'message' =&gt; '&lt;b&gt;CSRF&lt;/b&gt; is invalid', 'session' =&gt; new \\Laminas\\Session\\Container(), ], true); $this-&gt;add($csrf); where exampleCsrf must match the CSRF field's name in the form. Don't forget to modify both occurrences in this file. Make sure that you validate the form using its isValid method in the handler/controller where it is submitted. Render field Open the template that renders your form and add the following code somewhere between the form's opening and closing tags: {{ formElement(form.get('exampleCsrf')) }} Test the implementation Access your form from the browser and view its source. You should see a new hidden field, called exampleCsrf (or however you named it). After filling out the form, submitting it should work as before. In order to make sure that the new CSRF field works as expected, you can inspect the form using your browser's Developer tools and modify its value in any way. Submitting a filled out form should result in a validation error: CSRF is required and cannot be empty Timeout Note the timeout option in your PHP form's exampleCsrf field, with its default value set to 3600 . This represents the value in seconds for how long the token is valid. Submitting a form that has been rendered for longer than this value will result in a validation error: CSRF is invalid You can modify the value of timeout in each form, but the default value should work in most cases.","title":"Set Up CSRF"},{"location":"v5/how-to/csrf/#csrf-protection-in-forms","text":"A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack is a type of security vulnerability that tricks a user into performing actions on a web application in which they are authenticated, without their knowledge or consent.

In simpler terms, it's the act of providing dependencies for an object during instantiation. In PHP, dependency injection can be implemented in various ways, including through constructor injection, setter injection and property injection. Dotkernel Admin, through its dot-dependency-injection package focuses only on constructor injection. Usage Dotkernel Admin comes out of the box with the dot-dependency-injection package, which provides all the functionality injecting dependencies into any object you want. dot-dependency-injection determines the dependencies by looking at the #[Inject] attribute, added to the constructor of a class. Each dependency is specified as a separate parameter of the #[Inject] attribute. For our example we will inject AdminService and config dependencies into a AdminController . use Dot\\DependencyInjection\\Attribute\\Inject; class AdminController implements RequestHandlerInterface { #[Inject( AdminService::class, \"config\", )] public function __construct( protected AdminServiceInterface $adminService, protected array $config, ) { } } If your class needs the value of a specific configuration key, you can specify the path using dot notation: config.example The next step is to register the class in the ConfigProvider under factories using Dot\\DependencyInjection\\Factory\\AttributedServiceFactory::class . public function getDependencies(): array { return [ 'factories' =&gt; [ AdminController::class =&gt; AttributedServiceFactory::class ] ]; } That's it.

Web applications can protect users against these types of attacks by implementing CSRF tokens in their forms which are known only to the application that generated them and must be included when submitting forms. With each visit, a new CSRF token is added to the form so tokens are not reusable between forms. Missing to provide a valid CSRF token will result in a form validation error. Implement CSRF protection Implementing CSRF protection requires three steps: create new field using laminas/laminas-form 's CSRF element validate new field using laminas/laminas-session 's CSRF validator render field using laminas/laminas-form 's FormElement helper Create field Open the form's PHP class and append the following code to the method that initializes the fields (usually init ): $this-&gt;add( (new \\Laminas\\Form\\Element\\Csrf('exampleCsrf')) -&gt;setOptions([ 'csrf_options' =&gt; ['timeout' =&gt; 3600, 'session' =&gt; new Container()], ]) -&gt;setAttribute('required', true) ); where exampleCsrf should be a suggestive name that describes the purpose of the field (example: forgotPasswordCsrf ). Validate field Open the InputFilter that validates the form fields and append the following code to the method that initializes the fields (usually init ): $this-&gt;add(new \\Admin\\App\\InputFilter\\Input\\CsrfInput('exampleCsrf')); where exampleCsrf must match the CSRF field's name in the form. Don't forget to modify both occurrences in this file. Make sure that you validate the form using its isValid method in the handler/controller where it is submitted. Render field Open the template that renders your form and add the following code somewhere between the form's opening and closing tags: {{ formElement(form.get('exampleCsrf')) }} Test the implementation Access your form from the browser and view its source. You should see a new hidden field, called exampleCsrf (or however you named it). After filling out the form, submitting it should work as before. In order to make sure that the new CSRF field works as expected, you can inspect the form using your browser's Developer tools and modify its value in any way. Submitting a filled out form should result in a validation error: This field is required and cannot be empty. Timeout Note the timeout option in your PHP form's exampleCsrf field, with its default value set to 3600 . This represents the value in seconds for how long the token is valid. Submitting a form that has been rendered for longer than this value will result in a validation error: Invalid CSRF.

In simpler terms, it's the act of providing dependencies for an object during instantiation. In PHP, dependency injection can be implemented in various ways, including through constructor injection, setter injection and property injection. Dotkernel Admin, through its dot-dependency-injection package focuses only on constructor injection. Usage Dotkernel Admin comes out of the box with the dot-dependency-injection package, which provides all the functionality injecting dependencies into any object you want. dot-dependency-injection determines the dependencies by looking at the #[Inject] attribute, added to the constructor of a class. Each dependency is specified as a separate parameter of the #[Inject] attribute. For our example we will inject RouterInterface and AuthenticationServiceInterface dependencies into GetAccountLogoutHandler . use Dot\\DependencyInjection\\Attribute\\Inject; class GetAccountLogoutHandler implements RequestHandlerInterface { #[Inject( RouterInterface::class, AuthenticationServiceInterface::class, )] public function __construct( protected RouterInterface $router, protected AuthenticationServiceInterface $authenticationService, ) { } } If your class needs the value of a specific configuration key, you can specify the path using dot notation: config.example The next step is to register the class in the ConfigProvider under factories using Dot\\DependencyInjection\\Factory\\AttributedServiceFactory::class . public function getDependencies(): array { return [ 'factories' =&gt; [ GetAccountLogoutHandler::class =&gt; AttributedServiceFactory::class, ] ]; } That's it.

In simpler terms, it's the act of providing dependencies for an object during instantiation. In PHP, dependency injection can be implemented in various ways, including through constructor injection, setter injection and property injection. Dotkernel Admin, through its dot-dependency-injection package focuses only on constructor injection.","title":"Dependency Injection"},{"location":"v6/how-to/dependency-injection/#usage","text":"Dotkernel Admin comes out of the box with the dot-dependency-injection package, which provides all the functionality injecting dependencies into any object you want. dot-dependency-injection determines the dependencies by looking at the #[Inject] attribute, added to the constructor of a class. Each dependency is specified as a separate parameter of the #[Inject] attribute. For our example we will inject RouterInterface and AuthenticationServiceInterface dependencies into GetAccountLogoutHandler . use Dot\\DependencyInjection\\Attribute\\Inject; class GetAccountLogoutHandler implements RequestHandlerInterface { #[Inject( RouterInterface::class, AuthenticationServiceInterface::class, )] public function __construct( protected RouterInterface $router, protected AuthenticationServiceInterface $authenticationService, ) { } } If your class needs the value of a specific configuration key, you can specify the path using dot notation: config.example The next step is to register the class in the ConfigProvider under factories using Dot\\DependencyInjection\\Factory\\AttributedServiceFactory::class . public function getDependencies(): array { return [ 'factories' =&gt; [ GetAccountLogoutHandler::class =&gt; AttributedServiceFactory::class, ] ]; } That's it.
